Introduction :

A Priority Matrix is a tool used to sort tasks or project based on defined set of variables like Impact, Effort & Size. It helps individuals or team to develop clear action plans by categorizing and prioritizing tasks. It can be simple or complex as needed and incorporates multiple dimensions like impact, effort, urgency & financial implications.

So, focus on three points mainly.
that is Feasibility, Impact & Size.

x-axis denotes the feasibility, y-axis denotes the impact & bubbles denotes the size.

Basic Priority Matrix have these quadrants :

Quadrant 1 - HIGH IMPACT HIGH EFFORT

Quadrant 2 - HIGH IMPACT LOW EFFORT

Quadrant 3 - LOW IMPACT HIGH EFFORT

Quadrant 4 - LOW IMPACT LOW EFFORT
